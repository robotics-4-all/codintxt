Codin Textual DSL

## Introduction

CodinTxt is a textual DSL for automating the development process for the
[Codin low-code platform](https://codin.issel.ee.auth.gr/).

Codin was engineered by the [ISSEL Laboratory](https://lab.issel.ee.auth.gr/)
to automate the development process of Dashboards for Cyber-Physical Systems.
It provides a Web UI for developing Dashboards using drag-and-drop of various
components for remote monitoring and control of devices, applications and
systems.

CodinTxt defines a Metamodel for the Codin Platform (thus it is
Platform-specific) and allows definition of Dashboards using textual semantics,
while it also provides an **M2T Transformation** for generating a Json that can
be imported in Codin.

Below is the list of the currently supported Codin Components:
